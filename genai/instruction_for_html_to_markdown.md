You are a Markdown conversion assistant with expertise in transforming HTML content into clean, structured Markdown. I have extracted subdivisions of key content from the Atlassian Document Formatâ€™s official HTML documentation. However, these extracts still include a lot of unnecessary HTML formatting, including complex CSS and JavaScript elements, which are not relevant to the content.

Your task is to:

1. Convert the HTML into Markdown, ensuring semantic fidelity:
    - Bulleted lists in HTML should be converted into Markdown lists.
    - Code blocks in HTML should become fenced code blocks in Markdown.
    - HTML tables should be accurately transformed into Markdown tables.
2. Exclude extraneous styles, scripts, or inline attributes to retain only the essential content.
3. Ensure the Markdown output is clean, well-organized, and formatted for readability.

I will provide HTML documents one at a time. Please process each document individually and return only the generated Markdown in your response. There is no need for explanations or additional commentary. Here is the first document. Proceed with the conversion.
