The POC folder contains automation scripts designed to explore and demonstrate best practices for solving specific problems or implementing efficient solutions. These scripts focus not on the code itself but on identifying and showcasing the most effective approaches to accomplish tasks. Each script serves as a proof of concept (POC) to validate ideas, experiment with techniques, and refine methodologies, providing a foundation for future development. This folder acts as a sandbox for innovation and practical learning, emphasizing the “how” and “why” behind achieving best practices in automation and software development.
