We manually maintain a `real Confluence page <https://sanhehu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JWBMT/pages/294223873/Atlassian+Document+Format+Parser+Test>`_ (Confluence Cloud version) and try to include as much syntax and as many macros as possible for unit tests.

**Step 1**

Run `step1_download.py <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/atlas_doc_parser-project/blob/main/scripts/download_unit_test_data/step1_download.py>`_ to download the atlassian document json files.

**Step 2**

Run `step2_to_markdown.py <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/atlas_doc_parser-project/blob/main/scripts/download_unit_test_data/step2_to_markdown.py>`_ to convert this json file to markdown file. The ``Atlassian Document Format Parser Unit Test Data.md`` file is the generated markdown file (by us). You can compare it with the ``atlassian-document-format-parser-unit-test-data.md``, which is the generated by `Markdown exporter for confluence <https://help.narva.net/markdown-exporter-for-confluence/>`_ app.
